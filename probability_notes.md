Helpful probability formula:
P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|not B) * P(notB)

A sample space is a collection of all possible outcomes of a random experiment (e.g., {1,2,3,4,5,6}).
A random variable is a function defined on a sample space whose value depends on chance (e.g., could equal a number between 1 and 6 dependent on outcome of dice roll).

Disjoint vs independent events:
* Events are considered disjoint (also called mutually exclusive) if they never occur at the same time. For example, being a freshman and being a sophomore would be considered disjoint events.
* Independent events are unrelated events. For example, being a woman and being a freshman are independent events.
